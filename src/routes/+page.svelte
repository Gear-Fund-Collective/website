	<h2>WHY WE ARE HERE</h2>
	<p>
		There are undeniable logistical access issues and financial barriers to getting into the
		outdoors. Gear is expensive to the point of it being an impenetrable hurdle for some people to
		get what they need in order to participate. The goal of The Gear Fund Collective is to gain
		control of resources and facilitate the redistribution of these resources back into the
		community, helping to close the loop of consumerism, capitalism, and inaccessibility. Mutual aid
		is NOT charity- it is not saviorism- it is not philanthropy. So what IS Mutual Aid? From MADRVA,
		a mutual aid society in Richmond VA: “Mutual aid is the act of exchanging skills and
		redistributing resources for our collective benefit. It is a form of political participation,
		one that is rooted in the idea of caring for each other through a horizontal model of resources
		and power”. In mutual aid, there is no hierarchy, no leadership, and it is organized on a
		volunteer basis, thus making an effort to avoid potentially harmful power dynamics. Anyone can
		participate, or step back as capacity allows. Through this model we become beholden to each
		other and the community on a basis of interdependence, not obligation. It is important to
		remember that the oppressive aspects of our society (racism, class and capitalism,
		cis-heteropatriarchy, trans and queer antagonism, ableism, misogyny and misogynoir, etc.) will
		permeate any mutual aid effort. This framework asks us to reflect on the aspects of our
		identities that are privileged, and the parts that are not- a constant and evolving journey.
		Doing the uncomfortable work of calling in, reflecting, holding ourselves and each other
		accountable when we cause harm, and educating ourselves is of the utmost importance. This is
		what makes mutual aid an act of resistance, because we are actively working to deconstruct the
		systems of oppression both externally and internally. We can take care of us.
