	<h2>Request Gear</h2>
	<p>
		Our goal is to gather resources and facilitate redistribution back into the community in an
		effort to remove the barriers to accessibility. There are undeniable logistical access issues
		and financial barriers to getting into the outdoors, and oppressive aspects of our society
		(racism, class and capitalism, cis-heteropatriarchy, trans and queer antagonism, ableism,
		misogyny and misogynoir, etc) have historically created larger barriers for Black, Indigenous,
		People of Color, LGBTQIA2S+ and Adaptive folks.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			We aim to prioritize distribution to folks who identify as Black, Indigenous, People of Color,
			LGBTQIA2S+, Adaptive and/or people who have faced barriers in accessing the outdoors.
		</strong>
